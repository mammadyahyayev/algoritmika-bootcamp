          As a result of the incident, an emergency commission was convened.
          After studying the images from the Polish satellite Titan, and
          examining the wreckage of the spacecraft, scientists came to the
          conclusion that the launch vehicle crashed not due to the thermal
          effect of the layers of the atmosphere. and as a result of a strong
          impact at a speed of 10 km / s «into an obstacle of unexplained
          origin», called in the official report the firmament.
